Use Case 1: Semantic Search for DBT Models
Title: Semantic Search for DBT Models Metadata

Pitch: This solution aims to enable users to discover relevant DBT models based on natural language queries by leveraging semantic search. The system will index DBT modelsâ€™ metadata (like descriptions, tags, and column information) in a vector database, allowing users to search for models without requiring technical knowledge of SQL or the exact structure of the database.

Planned Deliverable(s):

A vector database storing DBT model metadata embeddings.
A semantic search interface where users can input queries in natural language and receive relevant DBT models.
Documentation on how to maintain and update the vector database as DBT models evolve.
Risks:

Data Consistency: The system relies on up-to-date metadata. If DBT models are modified without updating metadata, search results may become inaccurate.
Scalability: As the number of DBT models grows, the vector database may need optimization to maintain efficient retrieval speeds.
Embedding Accuracy: If the embedding model is not well-suited for the DBT-specific vocabulary, search relevance might suffer.
Use Case 2: Text-to-SQL Generation for DBT Models
Title: Text-to-SQL Generation for DBT Models

Pitch: To simplify data querying for non-technical users, this solution enables text-to-SQL generation tailored to DBT models. Users can input natural language queries, and the system will generate SQL code targeting the relevant DBT models. This approach reduces dependency on SQL expertise and enables broader access to data insights.

Planned Deliverable(s):

A language model-powered text-to-SQL generator capable of interpreting user queries and generating SQL statements.
Integration of a custom retriever to ensure SQL queries are aligned with the DBT model structure.
An intuitive interface allowing users to input queries in plain language and retrieve SQL queries specific to DBT models.
Risks:

SQL Accuracy: Generated SQL might not always align perfectly with user intent, particularly with complex or ambiguous queries.
Performance: SQL queries generated by the model may not be optimized, potentially impacting database performance if complex queries are run frequently.
Security: Generated SQL might inadvertently expose sensitive data if not properly validated against access controls.
